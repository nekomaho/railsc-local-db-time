# Rails Local DB Time
rails local db time is a gem that makes the display of Date and Time in railc localized.

On railsc, the UTC value is displayed by default when displaying the database Date and Time. This gem changes the Date and Time display to a localized version set by `config.time_zone`.

For example, a rails application localized setting blow.
```
config.time_zone = 'Tokyo'
```

The output changes as follows before and after using this gem.

- before
```ruby
irb(main):001:0> User.first
  User Load (0.1ms)  SELECT  "users".* FROM "users" ORDER BY "users"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
=> #<User id: 1, created_at: "2018-09-16 05:59:17 UTC", updated_at: "2018-09-16 05:59:17 UTC">
```

- after
```ruby
irb(main):001:0> User.first
  User Load (0.1ms)  SELECT  "users".* FROM "users" ORDER BY "users"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
=> #<User id: 1, created_at: "2018-09-16 23:59:17 +0900", updated_at: "2018-09-16 23:59:17 +0900">
```
